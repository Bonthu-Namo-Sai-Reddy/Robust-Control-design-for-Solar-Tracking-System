# Robust Control Design for Solar Tracking System
We are a team of six working on this project as part of Project-Based Learning under Skill Development in the Control Systems course. Our project is guided by Dr. Jitendra Sharma.

Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a robust solar tracking system that efficiently follows the sun's direction by rotating along the x-axis and y-axis. The system enhances solar energy capture by dynamically adjusting to sunlight variations, improving overall efficiency.

Stay tuned for updates on our progress! ðŸš€
